For readers of our 9900K review, you might remember a chart from our streaming benchmarks that illustrated power fall-off on the 9900K.
Most people think that Zen 2 is nothing more than a generational Frequency / IPC bump.
That was from hitting power limit 2, whereupon the CPU clocks down to meet TDP spec (~95W CPU Package Power). Let's reproduce that chart:
That is a very wrong assumption as Zen 2 as an architecture is entirely overhauled.

The jump from Zen to Zen+ was one incremental step, the jump from Zen+ to Zen 2 aims

to be a revolutionary step. Yes, the rumors claim that the IPC improvement and higher

clock speeds are there. They also mention that those are higher than expected on very early

engineering samples. This shows that final retail samples could be more than 15% IPC jump

versus what we have been hearing for a while. But it doesn’t end here.
