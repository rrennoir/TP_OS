Intel's TDP has long been questioned, but this particular generation put the 95W TDP under fire as users noticed media outlets
measuring power consumption at well over 100W on most boards. It isn't uncommon to see the 9900K at 150W or more in some AVX workloads,
like Blender, thus far-and-away exceeding the 95W number. Aside from TDP being an imperfect specification for power, there's also a lot 
that isn't understood about it â€“ including by motherboard manufacturers, apparently. All manufacturers are exceeding Intel guidance
for the Turbo boosting duration in some way, which is causing the uncharacteristically high power consumption that produces unfairly
advantaged performance results. The other end of this is that the 9900K looks much hotter in some tests.
For readers of our 9900K review, you might remember a chart from our streaming benchmarks that illustrated power fall-off on the 9900K.
That was from hitting power limit 2, whereupon the CPU clocks down to meet TDP spec (~95W CPU Package Power). Let's reproduce that chart:
