AMD’s Zen 2 architecture has long been in the works. AMD’s design team started
working on Zen 2right after the finished working on the first Zen architecture.
We know that refinements were made to the original architecture and we got the
new Zen+ design but the majority of the team was then working on completing
the design for Zen 2. In February of this year, it was reported that AMD had
finished designing the chip architecture and would be available for sampling later
this year with a range of products available starting 2019
Most people think that Zen 2 is nothing more than a generational Frequency / IPC bump.
That is a very wrong assumption as Zen 2 as an architecture is entirely overhauled.
The jump from Zen to Zen+ was one incremental step, the jump from Zen+ to Zen 2 aims
to be a revolutionary step. Yes, the rumors claim that the IPC improvement and higher
clock speeds are there. They also mention that those are higher than expected on very early
engineering samples. This shows that final retail samples could be more than 15% IPC jump
versus what we have been hearing for a while. But it doesn’t end here.
